Test your memory of current NBA players with the Clicky Game. Clicky Game is a memory skill application built using React. The objective of the game is to be able to go through and click each player's image once. Each time you click a player's image, your score goes up by one. If you click a player's image twice, you lose and the game resets (score goes back to 0).
